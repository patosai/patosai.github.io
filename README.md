Posts are in the `_posts` folder. The photography page is in `photography/index.md`.

To add a photograph, first install `exiftool` and `imagemagick`. Then be in the root directory of the repo, and then call `_scripts/addImage.sh` with the image as an argument. ex: `./_scripts/add_image.sh someimage.jpg`.
