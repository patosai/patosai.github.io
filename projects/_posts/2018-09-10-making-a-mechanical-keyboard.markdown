The first mechanical keyboard I bought was the Das Keyboard 4 Ultimate. I made the leap from regular rubber dome keyboards during my first summer in college after trying out some of my friends' keyboards and decided I liked the Das 4. I thought the $130 I paid then was already pretty high, but I was in for a shock when I saw the keyboards which had two halves, one for each hand. They claimed to be ergonomic, and must have been hard to manufacture as well given the 3D shape the circuit board had to accomodate! Nevertheless, $300+ keyboards were not for my taste and I decided to make my own.

How does a keyboard work?
